----------


**HTML5 Redux has everything H5BP has, but with the following enhancements:**

- More richer, and more semantic <HEAD> tag elements

- Holmes - Find out where you went wrong with your HTML

- Cabin.css - Cabin helps your projects get going quicker by eliminating the need for you to write basic CSS styles yourself.

- Open non-site-specific links / foreign domains in a new window

- Prefix Free. Lets you use only unprefixed CSS properties everywhere. It works behind the scenes, adding the current browser?s prefix to any CSS code, only when it?s needed.

- PIE. PIE makes Internet Explorer 6-9 capable of rendering several of the most useful CSS3 decoration features. Note: the path to PIE.htc must be relative to the HTML page, not the css!

- Custom webkit scrollbars.

- Formalize. We've all been there. You are nearly done with a beautiful site design, only to arrive at the task we all dread ? form styling. Depending on operating system and browser, default form elements can look okay or horribly disfigured.

- PNG Fix. This is a Javascript library that sandwiches PNG image support into IE6 without much fuss.

- Custom Cursors. (cursor.css) Custom CSS-powered cursors you can use in your page. 

- PNG Gauntlet. A tool that optimizes all your PNG files with ease. A (Windows) GUI alternative to PNGCrush.

- Less CSS. LESS extends CSS with dynamic behavior such as variables, mixins, operations and functions.

- H5BP UI. A bootstrap-like framework to get your project off the ground, based on H5BP (Utility)

- Hidden Microformats. Microformatted HTML is buried in the source, and hidden from view with CSS. Microformats give an extra semantic layer on top of a site.

- Shrinkr. A tool that automatically compresses CSS, and JS, via drag and drop. Drop your project's folder into the window, and it minifies everything. (Windows only. Java Required to run)
